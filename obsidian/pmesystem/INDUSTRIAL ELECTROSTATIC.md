precipitation is the leading and most versatile method for high-efficiency collection of dusts, fumes, and mists from industrial furnace and process gases. Despite its broad utility and range of practical applications, however, the fundamental physics and the basic engineering principles of the process have remained largely inaccessible. Existing literature on the subject is widely scattered through many domestic and foreign technical and scientific journals, and only very limited attempts have heretofore been made toward unified treatment. Among those working in this field, it has, in a curious sense, been everyone's yet no one's business. It has been my purpose, therefore, in the preparation of this volume, to provide a comprehensive and coherent account of the known scientific foundations and underlying engineering principles of the electrostatic precipitation process. The book is intended on the one hand for the use of engineers and scientists concerned with the technology of gas cleaning, air pollution control, and recovery of valuable particulate matter from gases, and, on the other, for research workers in electrostatic processes, gaseous electronics, and particle physics. The technical level of treatment is established by the state of the art and the needs of the subject, with no attempt to impose arbitrary limits. Emphasis is on modern developments and knowledge. It is shown how engineering formulation of the subject flows naturally from the fundamental principles and theory, and how precipitator design is formulated in terms of relevant basic properties of gases and particles. The book is based on twenty years of experience in both the fundamental research and the practical engineering aspects of electrostatic precipitation. It was my good fortune to know and work professionally with F. G. Cottrell, W. A. Schmidt, Evald Anderson, and other pioneers in this field. Much of the material on historical origins and early developments of the process was derived from these sources. As to the general plan of the volume, the first three chapters provide a basic introduction to the elements of the process, together with a fundamental treatment of the relevant characteristics of aerosols. Chapters 4, 5, 6, and 7 treat fundamental processes and physical theory. Chapters 8, 9, and 10 are concerned with the major technical questions of gas flow, particle resistivity, and particle reentrainment. The final chapter links the fundamentals with the practical design of precipitators. A comprehensive bibliography of several hundred references to the scientific and technical literature of electrostatic precipitation is included as an essential part of the work. I am indebted to my former colleagues Mr. L. M. Roberts and Dr. P. Cooperman for valuable discussions and material, and to Research-Cottrell, Inc., for aid on this project. Acknowledgment is made to Professors P. Drinker and L. E. Silverman of Harvard University for their helpful suggestions and comments. Mr. M. J. Archbold of the Commonwealth Edison Company supplied some of the photographs and field-operating data, for which I am grateful. I am especially indebted to Mr. H. A. Bauman of the Consolidated Edison Company who not only reviewed the manuscript but also contributed many cogent suggestions.

Growth and expansion of industrial operations which involve, for example, the processing of huge quantities of minerals and ores, as in smelting and metallurgy, or the combustion of hundreds of megatons of coal per year, as in the production of electric power, have given rise to the emission of 50 to 100 megatons of smoke, dust, and fume per year in the United States alone. Control of these emissions by adequate gas-cleaning processes is essential to prevent heavy, devastating air pollution, and, in many instances, to recover valuable materials, such as copper, lead, or gold which otherwise would be carried up the stack and lost by dispersion into the atmosphere. The problem of air pollution is one which grows with our modern civilization and, generally, is a direct result of it. To be sure, natural phenomena, such as fogs and the exhalations from decaying vegetable matter, do contribute to pollution and low visibility of the atmosphere, but by far the most serious sources of air pollution are man made. Gas-cleaning processes may be classified broadly as mechanical and electrical. Mechanical processes include all those which depend fundamentally on inertial or mechanical forces, namely, gravity settling, centrifugal, or cyclonic separation, gas washing, or scrubbing, filtration through screens, fabric bags, or packed beds, and sonic agglomeration. The electrical process, commonly referred to as electrostatic precipitation, differs basically from all mechanical methods in that the forces of separation acting on the suspended particles are electrical in nature. This fundamental difference is reflected in unique advantages both in operation and in application of the electrical method. Separation forces are applied directly to the particles themselves instead of to the entire gas stream, as in most mechanical-separation methods. This direct and economical use of forces explains the modest power requirements and low resistance to gas flow characteristic of the electrical method. It is limited neither to relatively coarse particles as gravitational and inertial methods are nor by resistance to the motion of the gas as filters and scrubbers are. Even the finest particles in the submicron size range are collected effectively by electrostatic precipitation because of the relatively large electric forces which act on the particles. There is no fundamental limit to the degree of cleaning attainable, and, in practice, most precipitator installations operate in the range of 90% to 99% efficiency, with some as high as 99.99%. The high collection efficiency, the low resistance to gas flow, the ability to treat huge gas quantities at high temperatures,* and the ability to cope successfully with corrosive atmospheres and particles account for the wide acceptance and diverse applications of the electrical precipitation process. The process is physical in character and is most accurately classified as electrophysics. Nevertheless, the actual practice of electrical precipitation involves a surprising number of scientific disciplines including physics, chemistry, aerosol technology, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, electronics, aerodynamics, mechanical engineering, and civil engineering. Despite the predominantly physical nature of the process, it is of interest to note that most of the pioneer work and practical development was initiated and carried out by chemists and metallurgists beginning with the work of Cottrell. Practical development of the electrical gas-cleaning process coincided with the renewed and increased attention focused on air-pollution control during the first decade of the twentieth century. The explosive advances in science and technology during the waning years of the nineteenth century provided the tools, and the social pressures and reactions against the widespread damaging effects of air pollution provided the motivation for controlling smoke and dust emission from industrial plants. These pressures were especially strong in the western United States where smoldering conflicts between the farmers and the rapidly growing copper-smelting industry frequently erupted into legal action against the smelters. Against this background, Cottrell, a native Californian schooled in physical chemistry in Germany under Ostwald, and regarded as the most brilliant young mind in the rapidly rising Chemistry Department of the University of California, applied his talents and energies to the technical problem of collecting or precipitating the objectionable smoke and fume particles from stack gases. Although the industrial smoke and dust problem was by no means new, existing control methods had proved to be impracticable or incapable of coping with the complexities of treating huge volumes of hot, dirty, and often corrosive gases. It was perhaps natural in these beginning years of the age of electricity to turn to electrical forces as a means for solving the smoke problem. Indeed, the electrical approach, based on Sir Oliver Lodge's work, had been tried unsuccessfully some twenty years earlier in England in an attempt to collect lead oxide fume. Cottrell's success with the electrical method of cleaning gases is ascribable chiefly to his recognition of the need for a better method of supplying the high-voltage power essential for the process. For this purpose, he turned to the rapidly developing field of alternating-current electricity and adapted the high-voltage transformer and synchronous-switch rectifier to his purpose. This approach, although obvious in the light of modern technology, was remarkable at the time as an example of intuitive action toward an effective solution of a previously baffling problem. The pioneer work of Cottrell, aided particularly by the contributions of W. A. Schmidt, laid the foundations for the rapid and widespread application of the electrical process for successful control of air pollution in the smelting and cement industries. Extension to other industries started early in the second decade of the century and still continues. Noteworthy expansion has occurred, especially since the late 1940's, and gives every promise of continuing at a high level. Air-pollution control remains as the most important application, but recovery of valuable dusts and fumes for economic reasons is also a major application. Other important fields of application are: purification of fuel and chemical-process gases to improve their quality; fractional collection of condensable vapors for chemical product or by-product recovery, separation of certain valuable or contaminant gases and vapors from gas streams by sorption on solid particles and removal of the particles; and high-efficiency air cleaning for offices, stores, and factories. A few words regarding the origins of the several identifying terms or names for the electrical process of separating particles from gases may be of interest. The term "electrostatic precipitation" is of quite recent origin and actually is less accurate than the earlier expression "electrical precipitation." The process is not truly "electrostatic" since corona currents of some magnitude usually occur. Nevertheless, the present trend is to include all high-voltage, low-current phenomena in the field of electrostatics. The first use of "electrical precipitation" is uncertain. Dion, in a patent filed in 1904, speaks of "particles or masses already precipitated by the action of the electric current." Cottrell, in 1909, used the expression "the precipitating action of electrical charges," and, in a 1914 paper, he used "electrical precipitation" freely. The term "Cottrell precipitator" originated in the smelting industry where it was used as early as 1912. ## 1.1. Historical origins. The electrostatic attraction of rubbed amber for small particles and fibers was known to the Greeks, probably as early as 600 B.C. The quantitative character of the electrostatic force involved was investigated by Coulomb [1]* and published during the period of 1785 through 1789. Coulomb's discovery of the inverse square law forms the basis of the science of electrostatics and also is the starting point for the theory of electrostatic precipitation. The first recorded reference to the electrical attraction of smoke particles appears in the famous work, De Magnete, of the English court physician, William Gilbert [2], in the year 1600. Gilbert describes the phenomenon thus, "Everything rushes towards electricks excepting flame and flaming bodies and the thinnest air . . . yet they entice smoke sent out by an extinguished light . . . Bodies are borne towards electricks in a straight line towards the center of the electrick." It is also of interest to note that about 1745, Benjamin Franklin began the study of the effect of points "in drawing off and throwing off the electric fire." Franklin's work seems to be the first on what we now refer to as the corona or brush discharge from sharp points. Experimental observations on electric discharges through smoke-filled gases and on the electric wind were also made by Beccaria [3] in 1772. Hohlfeld [4], in 1824, performed the experiment of clearing fog in a jar containing an electrified point, and Guitard [5] repeated the experiment in 1850, using tobacco smoke in a glass cylinder described as being nine inches in diameter and 18 inches long. However, Hohlfeld's and Guitard's experiments did not stimulate any practical study of the electrostatic-precipitation principle and were soon forgotten. They were brought to light again by Sir Oliver Lodge in 1905, many years after he had independently rediscovered the same phenomenon and brought it to public attention [6] in 1884. The work of two other experimenters appearing in the period between Guitard and Lodge also may be noted. In 1862, Gaugain [7] published what are probably the first experiments on the disruptive discharge between concentric-cylinder electrodes. Nahrwold [8], in 1878, experimented with the discharge from a sewing needle point in a tin cylinder, and he noticed that the electric discharge greatly increased the rate of settling or collection of atmospheric dust. He also tried coating the walls of the cylinder with glycerine to make the collected particles adhere; this was probably the first recognition of the difficulty of retaining dry particles on the collecting surface. As the result of Sir Oliver Lodge's researches on the subject, the first attempt to apply electrostatic precipitation commercially was made by Walker and Hutchings [9] at a lead-smelting works in Bagillt, North Wales, in 1885. Hutchings published a description of the installation, illustrated schematically in Fig. 1.1, as consisting of a system of metallic points situated in the flue from the lead furnaces and excited from two Wimhurst influence machines with glass plates five feet in diameter; and each machine was driven by a one-horsepower steam engine. The installation failed its purpose, due, in part, to the primitive method of producing high-tension electricity, and, in part, to the unfortunate choice of lead fume for the first commercial test. Lead fume is one of the most difficult dispersoids to precipitate because of its highly insulating character and very finely divided state. As is frequently the case in pioneer work, another investigator (Karl Moeller [10] of Brackwede, Germany) working independently rediscovered and patented electrostatic precipitation at about the same time. The idea was apparently suggested to him by Nahrwold's paper. Moeller's patent, however, was issued a few months after Walker's first patent. A few other articles and patents appeared in the years following Lodge's work and Lodge himself took out another patent in 1903 covering the use of the new mercury-arc rectifier for supplying high-voltage unidirectional currents for electrostatic precipitation. None of this work, however, was carried to the commercial stage, and electrostatic precipitation remained what it had been in 1885, a curious and intriguing laboratory experiment. Cottrell's pioneer developments. Cottrell's interest in gas cleaning seems to have originated not from the scientific aspect, but rather from public demand for control of air pollution caused by smelters. His initial work in this field was not electrical, but, instead, was based on a more prosaic approach using the principle of the ordinary centrifuge. There is no definite record of the events which led Cottrell to the electrical method. However, we can be certain that he was dissatisfied with the gas centrifuge method. Furthermore, Cottrell was working in an era of great research activity on electrical discharges in gases and rapid development of high-voltage, alternating-current technology. Cottrell's first experimental work [11] was on a small laboratory scale. He used a spark coil and a few discharge points in a chamber, an arrangement which worked quite well. In attempting to increase the precipitation capacity by using more discharge points, Cottrell found that the corona, or brush discharge, would transfer from point to point but would discharge from only one or two points at a time (because of insufficient power from the spark coil). To correct this, Cottrell, as a result of the partially accidental discovery that a cotton-covered wire gave a continuous glow on its surface, devised the pubescent electrode made of semiconducting fibrous material which in effect provided many small discharge points. The pubescent electrode gave a fairly uniform corona over its whole surface, even at the low power provided by the spark coil, and it functioned where the multiple discharge points failed. Realizing the need for a better source of high-potential electrical energy, in 1906, Cottrell turned to the newly developed, synchronous-mechanical rectifier [12] and the high-voltage, alternating-current transformer. However, transformer voltages, then readily attainable, were limited to values of about 10 kv to 15 kv, and the pubescent electrode still proved to be an important adjunct in obtaining reasonably uniform corona over extended lengths of discharge electrode. The first experiments with the synchronous rectifier were made (at the University of California in 1906) to precipitate sulfuric acid fume in a small test precipitator of a few cfm capacity. The choice of sulfuric acid fume for the first experiment was a fortunate one, for this material, although easy to collect by electrostatic precipitation, was frustratingly difficult to collect by the mechanical and wet methods then available. The gratifying success of these experiments soon led to the installation of commercial equipment, first at a powder works at Pinole, a few miles up the bay from Berkeley, and then at the nearby Selby smelter which was at that time embroiled in acute air-pollution difficulties. These first commercial precipitators, although crude in construction, were sound in principle. The Selby unit operated satisfactorily for many years. It handled about 5000 cfm of gas from parting kettles for the recovery of precious metal and collected about two gallons per minute of sulfuric acid which previously had been discharged to the atmosphere in the form of a fine mist. The essential features of Cottrell's precipitation system are shown in Fig. 1.2 which is reproduced from his first patent [13], issued in 1908. ![Fig. 1.2](image_url) Fig. 1.2. Illustration from Cottrell's first electrostatic precipitation patent, No. 895,729 (1908). Particularly to be noted are the synchronous rectifier and high-voltage step-up transformer, the pubescent discharge electrode, and the heater and ventilating systems for keeping the high-voltage insulator clean and dry. Not indicated in the drawing, but of equal importance, is the use of negative corona which Cottrell showed to be superior to positive corona because of the much higher voltages and currents which could be carried with the negative discharge. The success of the electric treater at Selby in collecting previously intractable sulfuric acid mist provided strong impetus for the application of the new process to larger problems in the smelting field. In the summer of 1910, Cottrell's third commercial precipitator [14] was, therefore, not only on the much larger scale of 250,000 cfm, but also was applied to the more formidable problem of collecting lead and zinc oxide fume at the Balaklala smelter located in the Copper Crescent district of northern California. Despite his reasonably adequate electrical equipment and the size of the precipitator, operation was far from smooth and had many baffling aspects. Nevertheless, these difficulties were gradually overcome and collection efficiency rose to around 80 to 90%, with recovery of about eight tons of fume precipitate per day. It is of interest to note that the cost of this entire precipitation system, including auxiliary flues, fans, and fume disposal means was approximately \$110,000 or a little over 40 cents per cfm. The Balaklala smelter was finally shut down in July, 1911 because of the sulfur dioxide nuisance which the precipitator could have corrected only if the sulfur dioxide could have been economically converted to sulfur trioxide. Nevertheless, the installation did demonstrate the practicability of large-scale electrostatic precipitation and soon led to the widespread adoption of the Cottrell process throughout the western smelting region. Further advances by W. A. Schmidt. Air-pollution problems during this period were by no means limited to smelters, and the next great advance in electrostatic precipitation came from an entirely different field, the Portland Cement industry in southern California. Lime and clay dust, emitted in large quantities from the cement kilns, settled on surrounding orange groves with damaging and costly effect. Cottrell, in answer to a query from the Riverside Portland Cement Company, believed that the precipitation process could be successfully applied to solve this difficult problem. New factors of size and complexity were involved in treating over 1,000,000 cfm of gas carrying 100 tons of dust per day at gas temperatures of 400°C to 500°C. The task of devising and constructing practical electrostatic precipitation equipment to meet these conditions was undertaken in 1910 by W. A. Schmidt [15], a former student of Cottrell's at the University of California. During the course of this work, Schmidt introduced and patented what has since proved to be one of the most fundamental advances in precipitation technology—the fine wire corona-discharge electrode. This new concept overcame the limitations and practical difficulties inherent in the pubescent electrode and provided the missing element essential for the large-scale development of the Cottrell process. Schmidt's work at Riverside was also notable in other directions. Experimentation and exploration of the mysteries and intricacies of the new process were in order and were pursued with zeal. Investigations included collecting electrodes, methods of supplying high-potential current, effects of sectionalizing the precipitator, and methods of controlling creepage and reentrainment of collected dust. For example, experimental work was conducted on collecting pipes up to four feet in diameter, operating at potentials of over 100 kv. Many of the subsequent advances in the art of electrostatic precipitation may be traced to these pioneering investigations. With the successful completion of the Riverside installation in 1912 and the rapid application of the process throughout the smelting field, electrostatic precipitation passed from infancy to childhood and adolescence. It was also at this juncture that Cottrell, a man of extremely broad interests and idealistic nature, transferred his activities to other fields and, except for a few published papers, was never again active in the field of electrical precipitation. With the financial backing of several associates, he formed Western Precipitation Company in 1907 to handle the commercial phases of his electrostatic precipitation endeavor. Cottrell had long cherished the idea of establishing a nonprofit foundation to administer and market patents emanating from universities and other similar institutions, with the net profits from such business to be used for the furtherance of scientific research. To this end in 1912, with the financial aid of a group of prominent industrialists and educators, he organized the Research Corporation [16] and turned over to it his valuable precipitation patent rights for the United States east of the Rocky Mountains, with the exception of the cement industry, as an initial endowment. His remaining interest, which included patent rights for the western United States and all foreign rights, was assigned to W. A. Schmidt. ## 1.2 Growth and applications.
